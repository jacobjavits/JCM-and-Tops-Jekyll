# About
{: .fancy-font }

Jake McKelvieÂ tours around the country both as a solo act and with his band, The Countertops. Having self-released numerous full-length albums and EPs over the years, he has carved himself a niche as a songwriter, combining a rapid delivery with stream-of-self-consciousness writing in a manner so singular that it is never in question whose songs are being played.
